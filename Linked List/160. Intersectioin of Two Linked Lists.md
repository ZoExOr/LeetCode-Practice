Java:
```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        ListNode A = headA, B = headB;

        if (headA == null || headB == null) return null;
        while(A != B){
            if (A == null) A = headB;
                else A = A.next;
            if (B == null) B = headA;
                else B = B.next;
        }
        return A;
    }
}
```
The key is to use **Two Pointers* to find the intersection listnode.

Pointers *A and *B points to the head of two linked lists. If both linked lists are null, return null.
Then A and B start iterating the linked lists:
-  A first iterates through List A then iterates through List B. That's to say, when *A == null, A = headB*.
-  B iterates through List B then List A. The same logic : when *B == null, B = headA*.

When *A == B*, which means they both iterate the same amount of listnodes and find the intersection listnode. This can prove mathematically.

Time Complexity: worst case O(a + b), a & b is the listnode numbers of two linked lists. (as in worst case, we iterate *a + b* nodes)
Space Complexity: O(1) (two pointers *a, *b takes constant space)
